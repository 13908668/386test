# Third-party cross-platform CPU performance test
# Project Introduction
I found that the godson performance water is very large, that spec2006 scores of serious fraud, can not retest, so the performance test program, used to open a fair test of all human CPU, including 51 single-chip microcomputer, this procedure can go up in 51 Line no problem!

At the same time I will send x86 and mobile phone running points
# Software Architecture
Test single core performance, three functions, the first step is 9,999-digit pi, the second step is integral, the third part of the mixed operation
This procedure can calculate the infinite digit pi, please carry on the parameter execution, the parameter is the running number of digits
such as Test 999999
On the 999,999-digit pi, my 3a3000 is broken during the test, and no 999,999-bit test is performed. P4 with vc2017, 999,999-digit spents 1 hours.

Godson 3a3000 due to forget 5 hours did not finish, forced off.

# Install Tutorial

Directly with GCC, or VC, or ICC can also use Godson's LCC after the implementation, if not in GCC, please bring-LM

How to use

It is suggested that the optimization parameters can be tried in the process of preparing.

#Report results
Please contact QQ 13908668 or send an email to 13908668@qq.com please explain the release, with the optimization parameters of Linux under the test, please perform UNAME-A verification system information, and photo upload. Win, please, after the test, the computer properties of the next open, verify the system information, and photo upload
